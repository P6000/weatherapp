A “Back” button that returns to the Main screen

## Technical Details

* Developed using Android Studio with Kotlin.
* Employs two parallel arrays to store day names and maximum temperatures.
* Uses `for` loops to iterate through the arrays for displaying data and calculating the average.
* Implements basic screen navigation using `Intent`s.
* Utilizes basic Android UI components such as `TextView` and `Button`.
